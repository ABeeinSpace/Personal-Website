# Hi!

I'm Aidan, a high school junior in Florida! This repository is going to house all of my web development adventures (or at least the stuff I'm comfortable putting online). Eventually it'll have a separate dev branch or some way of separating dev code from production code. It'll probably end up being a special folder since I'm not sure if I can point to a separate branch with BitBucket hosting. It'll also have a branch for Material Theme that will get merged into Master once it's complete. Material Theme is a LOT harder to develop in since it HATES being hosted from a CDN for some reason. 

Right now the most striking thing is the difference between the Landing Page site and the rest of the sites is the lack of CSS. The simple fact is that I ran out of time to theme the page. I'll get round to it eventually. For now just deal with the raw HTML. Eventually it'll become a full-featured about page with an aside thingy that will point to the different sites in the way that the current page does.
Anywho, that's just about it! Hopefully you like what you see!
