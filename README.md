# Hi!
I'm Aidan, a high school junior in Florida! This repository is going to house all of my web development adventures (or at least the stuff I'm comfortable putting online). There's some photography, there's my laptop, there's a buncha stuff! 
## About the Repository!
Feel free to contribute to layout and making the code less stupidly laid out, but I'd prefer that content is NOT modified. Also I'll allow the "master" branch to be modified for minor changes but for other stuff but major layout changes and stuff like that I'll want a seperate branch just so I dont have half complete code cluttering up master. I'm hosting from master so broken code in that branch is a Bad Thing.
