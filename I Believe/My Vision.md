# This page is REALLY ambitious

As such, the design is probably going to simplify as time goes on, but I want to stay as close to the original idea as possible.

It's going to begin with a title card, and as the user scrolls, the background will parallax blur out, and reveal a card to the side. It will have some content, then the parallax effect will end to reveal another image related to the content of the next card. As it comes into view, the parallax effect will begin again. Some content will be on the next card! Rinse and repeat. After all of my content, Steve Jobs with his head on his hand (you know the image I'm talking about) with a quote. The quote will probably end up being "Let the good times roll" or "Think Differently". I of course will credit everyone in the footer.

Hopefully my vision actually survives and I don't give up on it. I'm already having to wrestle with Google's Material Design layout. And I have a week to do this. Wish me luck!
