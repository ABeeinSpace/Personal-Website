                    This is a page where I intend to have a homepage of sorts for a web portfolio! Included will be
                    links to all of the stuff that I post to my BitBucket repository (I did have a GitHub but my school
                    blocks it [Thanks FLDOE!]. They do not block BitBucket however, so here I am). Eventually this page
                    will scroll for ages and there will be stuff on the side to jump to. The next goal is to get it to
                    smooth-scroll to them, but that probably needs some JavaScript, which I don't know whatsoever. It'll
                    be repurposed StackExchange code probably. :P
                    <p><strike>So this is cool! I got the header working now! Problem is when I commit it'll actually
                            not work anymore cuz I can't figure out how to upload an image using BitBucket. Stop
                            laughing.</strike>
                    </p>
                    <p><strike> I got it working fully! Now I need accessibility tweaks so the text is legible.</strike>
                        Got the header where I want it! I'm probably about to freeze development on the header except to
                        add new entries when I add more content. I'm really proud of it I'm not gonna lie.</p>

                    <h2 id="dev">My Escapades in Dev Work</h2>
                    <p>I went to a summer camp at Stetson, where I learned some Python. Unfortunately, I've forgotten
                        most of it simply because I haven't used it. Same with C#, and I've forgotten that one nearly
                        entirely. HTML and CSS however, I think I'm pretty good at. JavaScript is a maybe at best.</p>
                    <h2 id="not-dev">Computer Work Besides Development</h2>
                    <p>I hold Microsoft Office Specialist 2013 certifications in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and
                        Outlook, and I hold MOS Master based on a Word Expert certification. (Note that it's only for
                        Office 2013).</p>
                    <p><strike>I have a Dell Inspiron 2-in-1, running 2 operating systems. OS 1 (my primary system) is Apple macOS 10.15.4 Catalina, and the other one is Windows 10 1904 as an emergency system</strike></p>
                    <p>I have upgraded! My primary development system is now a 2020 Apple MacBook Pro running macOS 10.15.5 and Windows 10 version 1904 (soon to be 2004. I tried to go straight to 2004 and Boot Camp Assistant got really sad and wouldn't let me).</p>
                    <h2 id="photography">Photography</h2>
                    <p>One thing I have an interest in is photography. I have a lake behind my house so it's really easy
                        for me to get some AMAZING photography. The camera rigs I use are a DJI Mavic Air quadcopter, an
                        Apple iPhone 6S and an Apple iPhone 11. Some of it is below (Both of them are on the iPhone 6S):</p>

                <h2 id="goals">What I'm planning on doing after high school</h2>
                <p>I am going to Florida Southern College to study cybersecurity. After that, I'm going to put my
                    feelers out near the college and go from there.</p>
                <p><strike>My eventual plan is to go work for Google's Project Zero. Google formed the cybersecurity task force
                    after a vulnerability in Microsoft's Internet Explorer 6 allowed Google to be compromised. This is
                    the only time Google has been breached, which is a very impressive achievement considering how
                    lucrative of a target they must be. Project Zero ensures that Google and its users won't get screwed
                    over based off of another company's negligence. Either that, or I'll go work for SpaceX and hopefully go to space. Elon call me up.</strike></p>
                <p>My plans since I wrote that paragraph back in 2019 have definitely changed. Similarly to most people, my love of space has been largely reingited by SpaceX's Demo-2 crewed launch to the International Space Station </p>
                <h2 id="current">What I'm Working on Now</h2>
                <p>I'm working on a few things. For one, I'm working on this very website. I'm also working on learning a couple of programming languages. I'm working on vanilla JavaScript, React, and then depending on if I stick with it or not, React Native. You'll know when I get better at JavaScripting stuff when the dark mode/light mode switching gets not ridiculous.

<!--Hi! If you've found this, good on you! No. really, good job! I didn't expect anyone to actually look in the developer tools in a browser besides myself! Either that, or you've hit "View Source" or found my BitBucket! So now that you're here, I'm gonna show you somethin cool! On macOS or Linux, type "telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl". On Windows, you might need extra software such as PuTTY. Sit back and enjoy Star Wars in ASCII!
