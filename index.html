     <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
         This is a page where I intend to have a homepage of sorts for a web portfolio! Included will be links to all of the stuff that I post to my BitBucket repository (I did have a GitHub but my school blocks it [Thanks FLDOE!]. They do not block BitBucket however, so here I am). Eventually this page will scroll for ages and there will be stuff on the side to jump to. The next goal is to get it to smooth-scroll to them, but that probably needs some JavaScript, which I don't know whatsoever. It'll be repurposed StackExchange code probably. :P
		<p><strike>So this is cool! I got the header working now! Problem is when I commit it'll actually not work anymore cuz I can't figure out how to upload an image using BitBucket. Stop laughing.</strike> I got it working fully! Now I need accessibility tweaks so the text is legible.</p>

     I'm a Junior in high school in Florida! This is a website where I'll put up my escapades in web development and other shenanigans. My BitBucket will house web development and my GitHub will house other development projects (they'll move to BitBucket as I need them for school. Actually my most current work will be on BitBucket, so it's linked here first)

        <h2 id="dev">My Escapades in Dev Work</h2>
           <p>I went to a summer camp at Stetson, where I learned some Python. Unfortunately, I've forgotten most of it simply because I haven't used it. Same with C#, and I've forgotten that one nearly entirely. HTML and CSS however, I think I'm pretty good at.</p>
        <h2 id="not-dev">Computer Work Besides Development</h2>
           <p>I hold Microsoft Office Specialist 2013 certifications in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and Outlook, and I hold MOS Master based on a Word Expert certification. (Note that it's only for 2013).</p>
           <p>I have a Dell Inspiron 2-in-1, and it's currently running macOS Mojave. Some things are working, and some are not, but most things are working including the Mac App Store. Also Office is on there, which is good.</p>
